Nested contained lists are a way to index segment data. See
Alekseyenko & Lee (2007):

The following code was taken from the author's implemetation
in pygr (http://code.google.com/p/pygr) and modified. The
modifications include:

1. remove target coordinates, only target_id is kept.

pygr is available under the New BSD license.

Note:

I had trouble packaging this, the .pxd file was not found through gpipe/setup.py, though
cythoning the file itself worked fine. As a temporary fix, I added all declarations
of the .pxd file to the .pyx file and renamed the former to _cnestedlist.pxd
